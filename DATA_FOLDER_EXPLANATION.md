# Data Folder Explanation

## What the `data/` folder does:

The `data/` folder contains **pre-parsed, normalized JSON files** that are automatically generated by `data_loader.py`:

- `healthcare.json` - Parsed healthcare resources
- `education.json` - Parsed education resources  
- `resettlement_legal_shelter.json` - Parsed resettlement/legal/shelter resources

### Why these JSON files exist:

1. **Performance**: Parsing text files on every search is slow. JSON files are fast to load.
2. **Structured Data**: JSON contains normalized data:
   - `services` as arrays (not text)
   - `hours` as structured objects (not text)
   - `subcategories` extracted and normalized
   - `availability_badges` detected automatically
   - `languages` as arrays
   - `phone_digits` extracted for click-to-call

3. **Caching**: `data_loader.py` uses `@st.cache_data` to cache these JSON files

### How it works:

1. First run: `data_loader.py` parses `.txt` files → creates JSON files
2. Subsequent runs: Loads JSON directly (much faster!)
3. Cache invalidates after 1 hour (can refresh manually)

### Current Status:

✅ **JSON files exist** - All 3 categories have normalized JSON files
✅ **data_loader.py** can load them
❌ **chat_llama.py** is NOT using `data_loader.py` - it has its own parsing!

## Integration Issue:

`chat_llama.py` currently:
- Parses text files directly (slow)
- Uses simple text parsing (no subcategories, no badges)
- Doesn't benefit from the structured JSON data

**Should be using**: `data_loader.load_category_data()` to get structured JSON data!
